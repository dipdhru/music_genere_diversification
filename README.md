# Music Genre Classification using Big Data Analytics

A machine learning project that addresses genre ambiguity and overlap in Spotify's music categorization by combining acoustic features and lyric information.

## 📋 Project Overview

**Author:** Dipanshu Singh  
**Student ID:** GH1035704  
**Course:** M508 - Big Data Analytics

### Business Problem

Genre Ambiguity and Overlap in Spotify's Music Categorization presents a significant challenge:

- **Current Issue:** Many genres share similar audio characteristics (tempo, danceability, speechiness), making classification difficult
- **Examples:** Pop, EDM, and rap often exhibit overlapping features; rock and country have stylistic similarities

### Solution Approach

This project implements a multi-modal approach by:
- Merging **lyrics-based analysis** with **acoustic data**
- Creating more nuanced genre classifications
- Reducing genre overlap through advanced machine learning techniques

### Expected Impact

- Discovery of new, hybrid genres
- More diverse and accurate music recommendations
- Improved user experience through better categorization

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- **Python 3.11+**
- **Jupyter Notebook**
- **Machine Learning Libraries:**
  - scikit-learn
  - TensorFlow/Keras (if applicable)
  - pandas, numpy
- **NLP Libraries:**
  - spaCy
  - unidecode
- **Data Visualization:**
  - matplotlib
  - seaborn

## 📊 Dataset

The project uses Spotify music data with features including:
- Audio characteristics (tempo, energy, danceability, etc.)
- Lyric information
- Genre labels
